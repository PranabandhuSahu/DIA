        <p> <strong>What is the purpose of our intelligent content auditing platform?</strong>
          <br>The platform is designed to revolutionize digital inclusivity by
          evaluating web pages across diverse dimensions, including LGBTIQ+,
          ethnicity, race, gender, age, ability, economic status, education,
          location, language, nationality, and mental health.</p>

        <p><strong>Which dimensions are currently supported for analysis?</strong>
          <br>The platform currently supports analysis for gender, ethnicity, and
          geography, with plans to expand into additional inclusivity dimensions
          in the future.</p>

        <p><strong>How do I provide content for analysis?</strong>
          <br>Users can simply input the URL of the webpage they wish to scan, and
          the platform will analyze the content for potential biases and
          inclusivity issues.<p>

        <p><strong>How does the platform evaluate inclusivity in digital content?</strong>
          <br>The platform analyzes text, alt text,image Text under Text Category
          and images using a combination of:
          <br>
        Keyword-based detection for gender analysis (which users can customize).
          SpaCy for ethnicity-related terms and entities.
          Geographical entity extraction to evaluate regional inclusivity in the content.
          Pretrained Model to assess the Image</p>

        <p><strong>How is the analysis conducted for images?</strong>
          <br>Image content for representational biases, leveraging metadata, and
          descriptive attributes where applicable, powered by the Pretrained
          OpenAICV2 model for gender and ethnicity detection.</p>


        <p><strong>Which image formats are supported for analysis?</strong>
          <br>The platform supports analysis of images in JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and
          SVG formats, ensuring comprehensive compatibility.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I analyze both text and image content simultaneously?</strong>
          <br>Yes, the platform is designed to analyze both textual and visual
          content, including alt text and metadata associated with images.</p>

       <p><strong>How do I customize assessment criteria?</strong>
        <br>Users can configure keyword sets for gender-related analysis and
        adjust parameters for other dimensions to align with their specific
        inclusivity goals.</p>

       <p><strong>What kind of reports does the platform generate?</strong>
        <br>The platform generates detailed reports that include:
        Analysis of inclusivity gaps in text and images.
        A breakdown of results for each dimension.</p>

       <p><strong>Can I provide custom keywords for image and text analysis?</strong>
        <br>Yes, the platform allows users to add custom keywords for text and alt
        text analysis, making the auditing process adaptable to unique
        requirements.
        <br>However, for image analysis, custom keywords are not supported. The
        platform uses a pretrained OpenAICV2 model to evaluate gender and
        ethnicity in images, ensuring that the analysis is based on this
        advanced model's capabilities</p>

        analysis purposes.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the supported file formats for uploads?</strong>
        <br>For keyword search, we support Excel (XLSX) and CSV file formats for
        textual data. Images are not uploaded directly; instead, the platform
        analyzes images from the provided webpage URL.

        <p><strong>Does the platform support bulk uploads?</strong>
        <br>Currently, the platform does not support bulk uploads for text or
